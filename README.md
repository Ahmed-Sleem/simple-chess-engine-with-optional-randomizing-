simple chess engine with optional randomizing 

how to use :
- simply run the main.py file 
- choose your oponent play with white (w) or black (b)
- choose the depth of calculating (the engine will calculate how many moves after the inputed one)
- choose if you like the engine to choose randomly from the best moves calculated or not 
- then the engine will calculate the moves then return with the best move he can find 

** note :
it is a very simple bot 
it doesnt include any database of played games 
and i really dont expect much from it but i think it can play in rating above 1700 in average depth
